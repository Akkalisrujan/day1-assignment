    <title>The greatest India</title>

    The Greatest Indian was a poll sponsored by Reliance Mobile and conducted by
    Outlook magazine, in partnership with CNN-IBN and The History Channel. The
    poll was conducted from June to August 2012, with the winner, B. R.
    Ambedkar, announced on 11 August. A program associated with the poll aired
    from 4 June until 15 August.[1] Unlike other editions of Greatest Britons
    spin-offs, The Greatest Indian did not include people from all time periods
    of history. Two reasons were given for this choice. The first was that "the
    pre-independence history of India is dominated by Mahatma Gandhi and it is
    impossible for anyone to come close to the Father of the Nation when it
    comes to Leadership, Impact and Contribution. [...] The panel of experts
    felt that if Gandhi were to be included in the list, there would be no
    competition for title of The Greatest Indian".[2] Secondly, The Greatest
    Indian chose to focus on India as a modern nation: "India today is
    unrecognizable from the India that got independence in 1947.
